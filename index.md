## Getting started

The Sky OOB Guide is based on testing done by the amazing members of these Sky communities:
- [SkyOOB](https://discord.gg/h6JtXQv62y)
- Sky Necropolis (rip)
- [Sora](https://discord.gg/xqBTm2j)
- [Chatty Sheeps](https://discord.gg/XzKZ3gGTWe)
- SECRET OOB BROTHERHOOD

That means information here may differ from other sources, like the unofficial [Sky: Children of the Light Wiki](https://sky-children-of-the-light.fandom.com/wiki/The_Out_of_Bounds_(OOB)). The Sky OOB Guide will often feature a more up-to-date explanation with notes on making tricks and glitches more reliable.

After reading the [Terms and Methods](docs/terms-and-methods) page and the [Crediting](#crediting) section below, feel free to explore the documentation to find some tricks you're interested in!

## Crediting

Our communities believe in recognizing individuals for their contributions to our knowledgebase. If we have a definitive individual who is responsible for either the discovery or fine-tuning of a trick or glitch, their name will be listed alongside their work.

{: .important }
> If you would like to show off a trick you've learned here, kindly include the proper credit that we have provided for you.

*If you would like to challenge one of the listed credits with reasonable proof, please contact us on Discord so we can give credit to those who deserve it.*
