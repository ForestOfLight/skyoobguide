Spiraling is similar to [rocketing](../../clipping/#rocket), but it’s slower and more maneuverable. It’s performed in the same way as a Rocket, but one player offers to hold hands while the other asks for a piggyback. Both players will go through collision boxes. Simply let go of the other player to stop the launch.

{: .note }
> Clouds and other winds are not [collision boxes](../../terms-and-methods/#collision-boxes) and can sometimes stand in your way!

## Memory Candle Wrong Warp

> Coordinates are not loaded or are not saved during either the saving portion or the loading portion of this glitch.

This glitch lets us save our current coordinates and return to them whenever we like. You can do pretty much any action between saving and loading your coordinates aside from restarting the game. This includes going through loading zones and the works. This trick is useful for setting up yourself to teleport straight into an oob, or simply to save your location somewhere you want to return to--like a checkpoint for a particularly difficult oob. It doesn't even use up your memory candle spell!

Saving Coordinates:
1. Use a memory candle spell.
2. Start recording.
3. Go home or through a different [loading zone](../../terms-and-methods/#reset-walls-and-loading-zones).
4. As you white out, stop recording.

Loading Coordinates:
1. Use a memory candle spell in a location where a memory candle can be placed.

While not as readily useful as before the 0.14.5 patch, the second generation of spirals brings ease in the sense that you can descend and even stop midair whenever you like. Here are some things you can do:

- If the top person uses various sustained emotes, the spiral will descend on their screen.
- Changing your graphics settings does not have an effect on your vertical speed, but it does change your rotation speed.
- Sustained emotes cause lots of strange behavior.

## Spasm / Follow Clip

This clip can push you through horizontal [collision boxes](../../terms-and-methods/#collision-boxes) above you (ie. ceilings) or vertical [collision boxes](../../terms-and-methods/#collision-boxes) (ie. walls). The clip is best used on a flat ceiling but can work on heavily sloped ones as well. When clipping through a wall, make sure the wall is either vertical ( \| ) or getting steeper ( \ ), not shallower ( / ). Using a ceiling corner is most ideal.

1. Have a friend jump on your back with piggyback.
1. Fly up to a collision box.
1. When you’re as close to the collision box as you can be, tap the follow icon on your friend.
1. When you see your sky kid above the ceiling cancel the clip by moving the joystick. Careful not to fall back under the ceiling! (If you’re doing this with a wall, let your skykid turn 90° to clip.)

Sideways [rockets](../../clipping/#rocket), as you can imagine, can be rather useful for OOBing. This is a specialized version of a sideways rocket that shoots you out in a desired direction and then up. This trick is not used all that often, but it has its moments in the sun.

1. Place your table on any vertical surface.
1. Both players sit at the sideways table.
1. Stay on the table, but both players prepare for a [rocket](../../clipping/#rocket) by asking to piggyback. Be careful not to start following your friend by accident.
1. Tap the piggy button at the same time.

Have your friend jump on your back and then start flying and tap the follow button on them. The effect of doing so will suspend you in midair around your friend. The best part? Your flight power still increases.

## Spell Saver

Placeable Prop
{: .label .label-green }

It’s possible to place a prop spell without using up the prop. After activating the spell and dragging it out of the spell menu, tap anywhere outside the menu without lifting your finger to place the spell. The spell will be added back to your inventory!

## Reset Wall Removal / Immortality

This glitch has a very important function: It lets you go right through anything that might reset you. That includes both [reset walls](../../terms-and-methods/#reset-walls-and-loading-zones) and pesky fire trial demons (because they count as reset zones). The basic idea is to cut off transmission to Sky’s servers, enter an area, pass a reset wall, and then reconnect to the servers. Disconnecting from the servers is a little different for each platform. iOS is a little more inconsistent than Android due to this process.

| Android                                                                      | iOS                                         |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Simply disable wifi and data. Press retry when the reconnection box pops up. | The same as Android, but when you encounter the “Connect to the Internet to Continue Playing” screen, enable data from the Control Center (the menu when you swipe up from the bottom or top right of the screen) and, without closing the Control Center, disable it once the screen disappears. It will come up again after a few seconds, so be prepared to do this process a lot. It might help to be on graphics setting 0 if you’re having trouble. |

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/303jgo?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Disconnect from wifi and data outside of the area where you’d like to remove reset points.
2. Travel into the area.
3. Hit a reset point (often you’ll need to go OOB somehow).
4. Turn wifi and data back on.

## Loading Zone Hop

[Loading zones](../../terms-and-methods/#reset-walls-and-loading-zones) can be annoying when trying to go OOB. With this method, you can hop right past loading zones that are relatively thin. To perform it, start [rubberbanding](../../cosmetic/#drone) until your friend pauses for a second after moving into a loading zone. It won’t work with any loading zone deeper than your friend can go after fading out to a white screen, however. It’s better to be late than early when performing this trick.

Being late will make your friend disappear without you ever teleporting to them, being early (or if the loading zone is too thick) will teleport you through the loading zone with your friend. In addition, it’s helpful to get relatively close to the loading zone before you start [rubberbanding](../../cosmetic/#drone) to reduce the wait time between when you stop emoting and when you teleport to your friend.

## Why 0.15.0 to 0.19.1?

Sky progressed from version 0.14.5 to 0.19.1 during the time between version one of the Sky OOB Guide end of developement and the launch of version two.
