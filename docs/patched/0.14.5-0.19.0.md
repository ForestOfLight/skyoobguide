## Spasm / Follow Clip

Friend
{: .label .label-green }
Piggyback
{: .label .label-green }

{: .warning-title }
> Patch Implementation
>
> [COMING SOON]

This clip can push you through horizontal [collision boxes](../terms-and-methods/#collision-boxes) above you (ie. ceilings) or vertical [collision boxes](../terms-and-methods/#collision-boxes) (ie. walls). The clip is best used on a flat ceiling but can work on heavily sloped ones as well. When clipping through a wall, make sure the wall is either vertical ( \| ) or getting steeper ( \ ), not shallower ( / ). Using a ceiling corner is most ideal.

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/h283uc?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Have a friend jump on your back with piggyback.
2. Fly up to a collision box.
3. When you’re as close to the collision box as you can be, tap the follow icon on your friend.
4. When you see your sky kid above the ceiling cancel the clip by moving the joystick. Careful not to fall back under the ceiling! (If you’re doing this with a wall, let your skykid turn 90° to clip.)

## Spell Saver

Placeable Prop

> [COMING SOON]

It’s possible to place a prop spell without using up the prop. After activating the spell and dragging it out of the spell menu, tap anywhere outside the menu without lifting your finger to place the spell. The spell will be added back to your inventory!

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/rdrg4f?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

## Why 0.15.0 to 0.19.0?

Sky progressed from version 0.14.5 to 0.19.0 while version one of the Sky OOB Guide stopped being updated to when version two launched.

## Reset Wall Removal / Immortality

This glitch has a very important function: It lets you go right through anything that might reset you. That includes both [reset walls](./terms-and-methods/#reset-walls-and-loading-zones) and pesky fire trial demons (because they count as reset zones). The basic idea is to cut off transmission to Sky’s servers, enter an area, pass a reset wall, and then reconnect to the servers. Disconnecting from the servers is a little different for each platform. iOS is a little more inconsistent than Android due to this process.

  <dt>Android:</dt>
  <dd>Simply disable wifi and data. Press retry when the reconnection box pops up.</dd>
  <dt>iOS</dt>
  <dd>The same as Android, but when you encounter the “Connect to the Internet to Continue Playing” screen, enable data from the Control Center (the menu when you swipe up from the bottom or top right of the screen) and, without closing the Control Center, disable it once the screen disappears. It will come up again after a few seconds, so be prepared to do this process a lot. It might help to be on graphics setting 0 if you’re having trouble.</dd>

1. Disconnect from wifi and data outside of the area where you’d like to remove reset points.
2. Travel into the area.
3. Hit a reset point (often you’ll need to go OOB somehow).
4. Turn wifi and data back on.
