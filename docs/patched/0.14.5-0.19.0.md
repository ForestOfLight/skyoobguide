This clip can push you through horizontal [collision boxes](../terms-and-methods/#collision-boxes) above you (ie. ceilings) or vertical [collision boxes](../terms-and-methods/#collision-boxes) (ie. walls). The clip is best used on a flat ceiling but can work on heavily sloped ones as well. When clipping through a wall, make sure the wall is either vertical ( \| ) or getting steeper ( \ ), not shallower ( / ). Using a ceiling corner is most ideal.

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/h283uc?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Have a friend jump on your back with piggyback.
2. Fly up to a collision box.
3. When you’re as close to the collision box as you can be, tap the follow icon on your friend.
4. When you see your sky kid above the ceiling cancel the clip by moving the joystick. Careful not to fall back under the ceiling! (If you’re doing this with a wall, let your skykid turn 90° to clip.)

## Why 0.15.0 to 0.19.0?

Sky progressed from version 0.14.5 to 0.19.0 while version one of the Sky OOB Guide stopped being updated to when version two launched.
