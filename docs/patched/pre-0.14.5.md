## Pushing Into Wind Walls

Table
{: .label .label-green}

> Credit: ForestOfLight

Yes, this is possible. However, I’m sad to say most wind walls are most likely infinitely thick. This trick is possible because of the [Checkpoint](#checkpoint--table-teleport) glitch.

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/ydzkt7?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Place your table as far out as you can in the wind wall.
1. Perform the Checkpoint glitch.
1. If you’re spinning on top of your chair, open your emote menu.
1. Tap the flame (the button that pulls out your candle).
1. Immediately after take your table and place it further into the wind wall.
2. Sometimes you get thrown out of the wall immediately when you perform the Checkpoint glitch, just recover and perform Checkpoint again. It may help to use a different slope to perform Checkpoint on.

## Table Cooldown Skip

Placeable Prop
{: .label .label-green }

After placing your table once in a level, it’s possible to skip the cooldown after dragging the table out of the emote menu by simply tapping anywhere that closes the emote menu instead of lifting your finger to release your table. 

{: .highlight }
As of patch 0.14.5, this trick works *every other time* you place your table.

## Poof Warp / Disconnect Warp

Friend
{: .label .label-green }
Warp
{: .label .label-green }

When a friend is in the same area as you and they let out a call, you usually can see an eye icon on them. This also appears when your friend goes home or into another area without you. (Also when you warp to them from home, but that's not important.) When you warp to them Sky doesn’t know where to put you since they don’t exist anymore, so it takes you below the map (presumably 0, 0, 0). The timing for this glitch isn’t difficult, it often happens by accident when warping to friends after they get disconnected or leave the room in any way. Lots of areas have a failsafe to send you to a safe spot if this were to happen by mistake, however, some don’t.

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/do1tza?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

## Checkpoint / Table Teleport

Table
{: .label .label-green }

After placing your table somewhere, you can teleport to it whenever you like as long as it still exists. Tables disappear when you move too far away or leave the level.

1. Place down your table where you’d like to teleport to.
1. Take out your table and hold it near you.
1. Tap the “sit” button.
1. Tap to close the menu.
1. Let go of the table to place it down.

The timing of this glitch is a little hard to get a feel for. You want to go into the sitting animation and before you’ve fully sat down close the menu and release the table. To understand why this glitch works, try pulling out your table and then closing the menu. There’s a little bit of time between when you close the menu and when the table disappears. During the sitting animation, the game’s job is to have you sit at your table. When you tap the button the game commits to putting you at your table, but it can only be placed down to do that. That’s why you need to close the menu. If you place the table during the time it takes to put away the table after closing the menu it will still take away the table. However, the table was physically placed so you can sit at it before it is taken away. The game then transports you to where your table was previously placed because the game has committed to having you sit at your table.

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/n14okc?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

A couple of helpful things:
- Your checkpoint table can be placed so as to clip out of bounds. You’ll want to place the side with two chairs in the wall since those are the easiest to sit at when doing the glitch.
- The sit button is quite easy to miss, so my own personal practice is to always tap twice (not too quickly) when tapping the sit button. If I get haptic feedback (the little vibration) I’ll let go of the table.
- (Untested but generally a good idea:) Try to keep the table as stationary as possible when tapping the sit button because lots of movement can make it so your sky kid can’t sit down. (The same idea as pulling the chair out from under someone as they go to sit down lol.)
- If you’re not clipping or [pushing into wind walls](#pushing-into-wind-walls), you don’t actually have to sit down. If you position your table close to you (basically the same positioning as if you were going to sit) and then close the menu and release the table, you’ll still be teleported to it. Campfire users beware you have to be right on top of the central logs for this to work. It’s best to wait until your Sky Kid moves up on top of the logs to release the table.

You can teleport yourself around a level with this little trick. However, it is very difficult to control and will take you any distance it wants. While that doesn’t sound very useful, we are figuring out how to control it. This trick is much easier on the lowest graphics level because it runs at a slower frame rate. Any use of this after flying up a little in a level will double your height. You can easily take this trick up to the [farlands](https://streamable.com/mnfge1) on maps without reset walls, but beware it will get increasingly harder to land on your table.

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/ft3x9n?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Place your table and stand on it.
2. Open the emote menu and tap your table icon for a single frame.

{: .highlight }
This glitch is, in my opinion, the most difficult glitch to control of all. From my research, I’ve determined that it will double your position relative to the origin of the map you’re currently on (be mindful this includes vertically). Do with that what you will. It desperately needs more research to fully figure out how it works.

## Spiral / Piggy Spiral

Friend
{: .label .label-green }
Piggyback
{: .label .label-green }

Spiraling is a type of launch. When you and a friend are piggybacked and flying, grab the hand of your friend. You will start flying in a spiral up or down regardless of any collision boxes in their way (NOTE: Clouds are not a collision box, so won’t affect the glitch. However, strong winds are often in the clouds, and these can repel players and stop spirals).

The deciding factor for which direction (up or down) you will go is the size of the player leading. Check out these different perspectives of the same spirals:

| Above Normal Height                               | Below Normal Height                               |
|:--------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| ![](../../assets/videos/SpiralUpLeader.mp4)       | ![](../../assets/videos/SpiralDownLeader.mp4)     |
| ![](../../assets/videos/SpiralUpNonLeader.mp4)    | ![](../../assets/videos/SpiralDownNonLeader.mp4)  |

{: .note }
> Keep in mind the person leading will see the real location of both players (going through [collision boxes](../terms-and-methods/#collision-boxes)), while the player on their back will see them hitting collision boxes. When the leader lets go of the other player's hand, they will be teleported to the real location.

## Advanced Spiral Techniques

Friend
{: .label .label-green }
Piggyback
{: .label .label-green }
Sustained Emotes
{: .label .label-green }

The spiral can be manipulated in a few ways, each of which has its own effects. They are:
- The player on top using any [sustained emote](../terms-and-methods/#sustained-emotes) will make the spiral more vertical and, as a result, faster. (As of patch 0.13.0, this is always the case without the sustained emote.)
- Changing your [graphics settings](../terms-and-methods/#graphics-and-fps) will change your speed depending on FPS (0 is 2/3 speed, 1&3 are normal, 2 is 2x speed).

---

## Zoom Out

Changing the controls to one-handed mode lets you zoom out. You can keep the zoom by just switching back to two-handed mode. This persists until you change it from one-handed mode again. This can help you take your screenshots to the next level or, more usefully, help you see statues in Eden.

1. Tap the top right of your screen to go into settings.
1. Tap Control.
1. Tap One-Handed Mode.
1. Pinch your fingers to zoom out and spread your fingers to zoom in.
1. Repeat steps 1-3, but tap Two-Handed Mode to change your control scheme back to two-handed mode.

## Rainbow Checkpoint / Rainbow Table Teleport

Friend
{: .label .label-green }
Warp
{: .label .label-green }
Table
{: .label .label-green }
Rainbow Spell
{: .label .label-green }

The successor of the beloved [Checkpoint](#checkpoint--table-teleport) glitch. This glitch can be very complicated, but luckily only the person who owns the table needs to know how to perform it. This glitch essentially has the same function as the old Checkpoint glitch, just slower. This glitch will teleport a friend to where your table is placed so you can warp to them.

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/i1ncbx?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Place down your table where you’d like to set your checkpoint.
1. Have your friend sit at your table to make it solid for them.
1. Fly away, do whatever you need, etc.
1. Activate a rainbow spell.
1. Drag the rainbow out of the menu and perform a Spell Saver, placing the “fake rainbow” near you.
1. Your friend will be able to see the seats from your table where you placed the rainbow.
1. Have your friend sit at the “fake rainbow.” They will be teleported to your real table but won’t see it from their view.
1. Warp to your friend and then let go.
1. Have your friend warp to you.

## Rainbow Teleport

Table
{: .label .label-green }
Rainbow Spell
{: .label .label-green }

This glitch is basically [driving](../advanced/#drive--advanced-table-uber) with a rainbow spell. It can easily be used in combination with a normal Drive. Simply place a rainbow instead of your table to be teleported to it. This is useful because rainbow spells can be placed at a much further distance than tables can. It will not make you follow where you drag the rainbow, but it will teleport you after you place it. Important: Make sure you do the Spell Saver method when placing the rainbow so that the spell doesn’t get used but the fake table is still placed. When you’re ready, just let go of your friend’s hand to stop the glitch. Your friend sitting at your table will not see themselves move when you place a fake rainbow but they will see you move. They can either warp to you or, when the glitch is still active, you can place your table normally to get them where you are. Something extra and interesting about this glitch is that it will always position the fake table completely horizontal, so it can be used as a clipping method as well.

## Bicycle / Directional Rocket

Various Emotes
{: .label .label-green }

Extremely useful because of their convenience and consistency, bicycles can take you in any direction: Up, down, and sideways. Because of the difficult setup, this glitch is meant to be performed by two well-experienced OOBers.

1. Both players offer to piggyback on one another.
1. Player 1 accepts the offer and does a sustained emote directly after.
1. Player 1 should end up behind or inside Player 2 while being “on” Player 2’s back. Player 2 should still be able to see Player 1’s 1. piggy offer. If not, start over.
1. To start the launch, Player 2 simply taps the piggy offer. In order to go sideways or down, Player 2 must use the same emote as Player 1.
1. When finished, just let go of the other person’s hand to bring them to you.

The most useful sustained emotes to control your skew are:
- Come (Preferably lvl 3 or 4) for sideways
- Point (When Player 1 is doing Come)
- Play dead for down (will take you through water)
- The launch will send both players directly behind where Player 2 is facing in a normal-looking rocket until Player 2 completes step 4

{: .note }
> Player 1’s setup for this glitch is much more difficult with a level 3 or 4 emote but it gets easier each time you get it right. My own practice is to start charging the emote, accepting piggy when it reaches lvl 2, and letting go when it hits lvl3 directly after. Player 1 cannot land on Player 2’s back for their piggy button to still be active. This glitch is difficult to explain so these videos will be very helpful when learning:

> You can change your speed by changing your [graphics mode](../terms-and-methods/#graphics-and-fps). Changing the game’s FPS will change the speed of the launch from your point of view (0 is 2/3 speed, 1&3 are normal, 2 is 2x speed)
