# Terms and Methods
Since OOBing can be a complicated process and some of the mechanics are not given a name in the game or need to be defined further, this section is necessary for understanding the Sky OOB Guide as well as people in our communities.

**Glide/Flight Mode:**
The default mode when you’re in the air will be referred to as glide mode. The longer, more controlled mode will be referred to as flight mode.

**Prop:**
Any item you can wear on your back.

**Placeable Prop:**
Any prop that can be placed in the world, such as table, feast table, campfire, swing, seesaw, tea set, shelf, hammock, torch, pillow.

**Table:**
Any prop that can be placed in the world that players can sit at, such as the table, feast table, campfire, swing, seesaw, tea set, and hammock.

**Sustained Emote:**
Any emote that continues infinitely until you move your skykid or perform another action. They include:
| Point             | Peek              | March             | Voila
| Come              | Handstand         | Telekenesis       | Navigate
| Welcome           | Boogie Dance      | Float (Meditate)  | Calm Down
| Butterfly         | Crab Walk         | Pray              | Ouch
| Clap              | Spin Trick        | Sparkler          | Headbob
| Belly Scratch     | Duck              | Doze              | Waving Light
| Shiver            | Faint (Play Dead) | Balance           | Raise the Roof
| Apologize         | Salute            | Slouch            | Rhythmic Clap

Graphics and FPS: In the settings menu ingame, there’s a battery icon. This sets not only your graphics quality but also how smoothly the game runs. This is the FPS, or frames per second. There are four settings: 0, 1, 2, and 3. 0 runs at 20fps, 1 and 3 run at 30fps, and 2 runs at 60fps.

Freezing: Lightly disconnects a player from the game for the duration of the freeze. This is useful in multiple tricks. For both iOS and Android: Go into multitasking. For Switch: Press the HOME button. iOS has the added bonus that you can see the game while you’re frozen. The freeze ends when you go back into the game.

Loading Zone: When you go through this area, your skykid gets sent to a different level.

Reset Wall: When you go through this area, your skykid gets reset to the intended place within the same level.
