# Terms and Methods
Since OOBing can be a complicated process and some of the mechanics are not given a name in the game or need to be defined further, this section is necessary for understanding the Sky OOB Guide as well as people in our communities. Feel free to refer to this page if you are confused by a term you're reading.

### Glide/Flight Mode
The default mode when you’re in the air will be referred to as glide mode. The longer, more controlled mode will be referred to as flight mode.

### Sustained Emotes
Any emote that continues infinitely until you move your skykid or perform another action. They include:

| Point             | Peek              | March             | Voila             |
| Come              | Handstand         | Telekenesis       | Navigate          |
| Welcome           | Boogie Dance      | Float (Meditate)  | Calm Down         |
| Butterfly         | Crab Walk         | Pray              | Ouch              |
| Clap              | Spin Trick        | Sparkler          | Headbob           |
| Belly Scratch     | Duck              | Doze              | Waving Light      |
| Shiver            | Faint (Play Dead) | Balance           | Raise the Roof    |
| Apologize         | Salute            | Slouch            | Rhythmic Clap     |

### Props
A prop is any item that you can wear on your back, like an instrument or table. Props that players can sit at are known as Tables. You can see a list of props and their categorizations [here](https://sky-children-of-the-light.fandom.com/wiki/Props#Availability_Legend).

### Graphics and FPS
In the settings menu ingame, there’s a battery icon. This sets not only your graphics quality but also many frames are shown per second (FPS). There are four settings: 0, 1, 2, and 3. 0 runs at 20fps, 1 and 3 run at 30fps, and 2 runs at 60fps.

### Freezing
{ .warning }
> This section is slightly outdated. Freezing works the same, but has different effects.

Lightly disconnects a player from the game so that your position does not change (or changes more slowly) for the duration of the freeze.
iOS and Android: Go into multitasking or lock your device.
Switch: Press the HOME button.

### Reset Walls and Loading Zones
When you go through a reset wall, your skykid gets sent to a predefined place within the same level. When you go through a loading zone, your skykid gets sent to a different level entirely.
