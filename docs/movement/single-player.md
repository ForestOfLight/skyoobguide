# Single-Player Movement
{: .no_toc }

Single-player movements are tricks and glitches that can be done with one player to move around in interesting ways. These can generally help make your solo candle runs as well as oob adventures faster.

## Fast Fall / Sliding Fall

Fast falling is one of the quickest ways to descend. Simply go off an edge while sliding to be affected by gravity like a no-wing. The fall only lasts a short while (but long enough to be very useful), and less if you are holding a direction on the joystick. The more “tilt” (or no tilt) on the joystick the faster it’ll end. The optimal placement is just outside the center of the joystick area. This fall is different from gliding downwards (Sky kid has their hands in the air) and much faster. It’s around as fast as doing straight downwards in flight mode. Once in a sliding fall, you can stop it by flapping your wings in glide mode (kills all momentum) or going into flight mode and pulling up on the joystick (doesn’t kill downward momentum).

## Emote Fall / Sustained Emote Fall

While in glide mode, using sustained emotes makes you fall at crazy fast speeds. The most convenient of these is the point emote since it’s the first sustained emote in the menu. After a second or so the emote will stop and you’ll need to tap the emote again.

## Midair Prop Placement

Placeable Prop
{: .label .label-green }

Simply tap/drag/flick the prop icon in your emote menu while away from any placeable surfaces and it’ll spawn in midair. The prop will place a short distance away from you in the direction your camera is facing. If you get your camera right, you can place the table right in front of you and land on it while actively flying. Every other tap will put away your table, so this works every other time. Just tap twice to place it for a second time.

## Vertical Flight

This is a difficult yet useful trick for any speedy candle runner. It lets you take off in flight mode straight from the ground and fly vertically into the air. It will take some practice to pull off and some more to pull off consistently, but it has immediate implications for shortcuts. This glitch can be performed both on the ground or in the air.

1. Start sliding. The best way to do this is to hold forward and jump once or twice.
2. Hold the fly button to flap once.
3. Slide your finger down the joystick and go into flight mode at the same time.
4. Hold your finger still on the joystick or take it off and flap often enough to keep the flying vertically. Feel free to move the camera.

> Notes
>
> - Sliding fast enough to go into flight mode automatically when you take off causes this trick to fail.
> - If you successfully start flying upwards but bank back the way you came, you’ve swiped too harshly and/or moved your joystick after flying.
> - Watching videos of this trick will honestly help you learn it. Get started with [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTowmXHAfZ4).
