Multi-player movements are tricks and glitches that can be done with multiple players to move around in interesting ways. These can be used mostly just for a bit of fun with friends.

## Ground Warp

This trick lets you warp onto the ground from any height above. It even ignores wind walls and clouds. Unfortunately, much easier to be tall to perform this glitch. Chibi kids’ legs are simply too short to accomplish the first step easily.

1. Get your player to stand on the very edge of the prop so that their center is not over the prop.
2. Tap on your friend and offer to do any emote with them.

Ever want to just stop, midair, with nothing around? This trick lets you levitate on nothing at all while doing any emote offered to a friend. This makes for some amazing screenshots.

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/fs3rex?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Stand on your prop and offer to do any emote with a friend.
2. Move your prop (If you just tap the table icon, your table will disappear completely).

## Follow Stall

Friend

Follow stalling is a way to come to a stop midair (and charge your wings a tiny bit) without the use of piggyback or a table. It's less useful than other tricks that do similar things, but it could save you in a pinch or in a location where props and friend emotes are inaccessible. Both players simply follow one another and you'll end up stationary in the air. If you have trouble with spiraling downward, try approaching your friend from below. This trick works even more nicely if one player has a good [permanent freeze](../../terms-and-methods/#freezing).

## Poof Warp v2

This is a revival of the patched [poof warp](../../patched/pre-0.14.5/#poof-warp--disconnect-warp) behavior. This trick will take you to a spot under the map (with coordinates 0, 0, 0) called the "shadow spot" or "zero point." Here’s how to do it:

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/9ybibb?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Place the hammock.
2. Have your friend lay in it and offer their hand.
3. Drag out the hammock again. When they are teleported, grab their hand.
4. Release the hammock.
