{: .no_toc }

Multi-player movements are tricks and glitches that can be done with multiple players to move around in interesting ways. These can be used mostly just for a bit of fun with friends.

## Directional Rocket

A [rocket](../../clipping/#rocket) where you can easily point where you'd like to fly toward is extremely useful for getting places quickly--not to mention that it flies through wind walls just like a normal rocket. In this trick, both players are in charge of their *friend*'s rocket direction, not their own.

1. Both players offer each other piggyback.
2. Your friend takes out their firework staff to position their player.
   1. You will rocket in the direction that your friend's head points.
3. Both player accept piggyback at the same time.

## Table Drive

Friend
{: .label .label-green }
Table
{: .label .label-green }

{: .warning }
> As of the 0.19.1 patch, this is not a continuous ride but you can still place the table to move you and your friends.

This more complicated version of the Uber glitch can bring you as well as up to four other players on a ride. What this glitch actually does is the same as a [table uber](../../clipping/#table-uber), but you are holding the hand of one of your friends so you go with them.

1. Place your table.
2. Have a friend sit at the table (You don’t need to sit at it).
3. Tap your friend to make the follow icon appear and tap it to follow them.
4. Have your friend prepare by opening the friendship menu by tapping on you.
5. Tap the hold hands button above your friend’s head. At the same time, have your friend offer to hold your hand from the friendship menu. This puts you into a state where both of you just stand there on the chair. (It’s easiest to count down with beeps.)
6. Move the table and place it down. You and your friend will go where it does!

{: .note-title }
> Note for #5

> The goal is to be in the process of grabbing your friend’s hand while they start their offering animation. This way they are still offering even though you’re already holding their hand. However, a simpler way may be to just warp to your friend while they're already offering their hand.

## Ground Warp

Friend

Placeable Prop

This trick lets you warp onto the ground from any height above. It even ignores wind walls and clouds. [Legging](../../terms-and-methods/#legging) is not required for this trick but it makes it easier--especially for chibis and other short players. In most cases, your friend can just accept your friendship emote to warp to you.

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/kc4ubl?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Use [legging](../../terms-and-methods/#legging) to get your player's center off the prop.
2. Tap on your friend and offer to do any emote with them.

## Levitation / Stall

Ever want to just stop, midair, with nothing around? This trick lets you levitate on nothing at all while doing any emote offered to a friend. This makes for some amazing screenshots.

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/fs3rex?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Stand on your prop and offer to do any emote with a friend.
2. Move your prop (If you just tap the table icon, your table will disappear completely).

## Follow Stall

Friend
{: .label .label-green }

Follow stalling is a way to come to a stop midair (and charge your wings a tiny bit) without the use of piggyback or a table. It's less useful than other tricks that do similar things, but it could save you in a pinch or in a location where props and friend emotes are inaccessible. Both players simply follow one another and you'll end up stationary in the air. If you have trouble with spiraling downward, try approaching your friend from below. This trick works even more nicely if one player has a good [permanent freeze](../../terms-and-methods/#freezing).

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.500%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/976l0v?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

## Poof Warp v2

Friend

Hammock

> Credit: Saint for discovery, ForestOfLight for optimization

This is a revival of the patched [poof warp](../../patched/pre-0.14.5/#poof-warp--disconnect-warp) behavior. This trick will take you to a spot on (or under) the map we lovingly call [the origin](../../terms-and-methods/#the-origin). Here’s how to do it:

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/z7n8kd?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Place the hammock.
2. Have your friend lay in it and offer their hand.
3. Drag out the hammock again. When they are teleported, grab their hand.
4. Release the hammock.
