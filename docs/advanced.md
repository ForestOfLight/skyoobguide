# Advanced Tricks
{: .no_toc }

This section is primarily about combining tricks to your advantage but it also includes higher-level expansions on tricks and glitches stated earlier for players who'd like to fine tune their skills even more. Learning these mechanics can greatly improve the speed and accuracy with which you can perform them. This tech is also generally more difficult to pull off.

## Advanced Rocketing

Friend

Rocketing is a bit of an art. It may seem inconsistent because there are many factors to determine your launch. First, you must understand that what your screen shows and what your friend’s screen shows are different. Each player launches in the direction they’re facing (as well as up). The player to let go of the other first will be the leader. Whoever doesn’t let go will be sent to the other player. So, decide who will lead before launching, and position the leader facing the desired launch direction with the other player in front of them, facing them. 

Here are two videos showing the same launch from both players’ perspectives. Notice the difference in direction.

| Player One                                            | Player Two                                             |
|:------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------|

Something else to take into account when rocketing is player height. Jumping onto a smaller player will give you a larger angle. Jumping onto a larger player will give you a smaller angle.

Another factor is your graphics settings. Changing the game’s FPS will change the speed of the launch from your point of view (0 is 2/3 speed, 1&3 are normal, 2 is 2x speed).

If you’d like to go underwater, simply start the rocket in the water. Only one player will go underwater so that player must let go. Be wary of crashes!

As of patch 0.14.5, the only effect of the Bicycle [PATCHED] glitch is that it will send both players on the same Rocket-like trajectory.

While not as readily useful as before the 0.14.5 patch, the second generation of spirals brings ease in the sense that you can descend and even stop midair whenever you like. Here are some things you can do:

- If the top person uses various sustained emotes, the spiral will descend on their screen.
- Changing your graphics settings does not have an effect on your vertical speed, but it does change your rotation speed.
- Sustained emotes cause lots of strange behavior. Contact Forest with results.

## Drive / Advanced Table Uber 

Friend
{: .label .label-green }
Table
{: .label .label-green }

This more complicated version of the Uber glitch can bring you as well as up to four other players on a ride. What this glitch actually does is the same as the Uber Clip, but you are holding the hand of one of your friends so you go with them. Video

![](https://www.reddit.com/user/hondo7059/comments/ip60qc/table_surf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

1. Place your table.
1. Have a friend sit at the table (You don’t need to sit at it).
1. Tap your friend to make the follow icon appear and tap it to follow them.
1. Have your friend prepare by opening the friendship menu by tapping on you.
1. Since you just tapped the follow button, there will be a “hold hands” button above your friend’s head. At the same time, tap this and have your friend offer to hold your hand from your friendship menu. This puts you into a state where both of you just stand there on the chair. (It’s easiest to count to three with beeps, as in the video.)
1. Move the table and place it down. You and your friend will go where it does!

This glitch creates the same effect as the Driving [PATCHED] glitch, but it moves much quicker.

![](../../assets/videos/Sonic.qt)

1. Place your table.
1. Have a friend sit at the table.
1. Have your friend [freeze](./terms-and-methods/#freezing).
1. Grab the hand of your friend by tapping the “follow” button and then the “hold hands” button.
1. Drag your table out and zoooom.

## Offset Rocket

Sideways [rockets](./clipping/#rocket--piggy), as you can imagine, can be rather useful for OOBing. Their effect is to shoot you out in a desired direction and then up. They’re used to start a rocket not where you are, but a little ways away. This trick is not used all that often, but it has its moments in the sun.

1. Place your table on any vertical surface.
2. Both players sit at the sideways table.
3. Stay on the table, but both players prepare for a [rocket](./clipping/#rocket--piggy) by asking to piggyback. Be careful not to start following your friend by accident.
4. Tap the piggy button at the same time.

> Looking to do this on flat ground? Place one table flat and then another on the side of that table! You can even use a spell for one of the tables.

## Legging Clip / Advanced Chibi Clip

This section is an expansion on the [Chibi Clip](./clipping/#chibi-clip--chibi-fall). The sneaky stance isn’t strictly required to perform this glitch, but it is highly recommended as it makes the glitch much more consistent. It’s also possible to do this without being chibi at all. Not much is known about clipping like this without chibi or the sneaky stance because it’s so fiddly.

**General tricks:**
- When active, the Firework Staff, Harp, Horn, Umbrella (not Lightseekers Ultimate Gift), Flute, Bass Drum (from Season of Prophecy), and Lantern can be a replacement for the sneaky stance.
- If you have the tea table you can clip into a flat floor by positioning yourself near a cup, [legging](./terms-and-methods/#legging) a foot towards the ground, and performing a Chibi Clip. Credit: Dough

## Pushing Through Water

Friend

This glitch can be used to much more actively control your position underwater than other underwater tricks. This glitch was previously able to be performed in the same way as with wind walls. However, it can be done much easier (and now faster) with the help of a friend. Careful in oil (water that depletes your light) though, it doesn’t stop hurting under the surface!

![](../../assets/videos/Pushing Through Water.mov)

1. Initiate an [Advanced Uber](#drive--advanced-table-uber).
1. Drag your table as far as you can underwater.
1. Use the [midair table placement](./movement/single-player/#midair-prop-placement) mechanic to place the table where you’d like to go by facing your camera in the desired direction. Be cautious not to have any placeable surfaces in the direction you’re facing.
1. Since it only moves you a little bit, repeat step 3 until you’re in whatever location you’d like! Careful not to tap any of the “hold hand” or “sit” buttons on-screen (your friend shouldn’t either).

{: .highlight }
> More friends can go for the ride by holding your hand before initiating the Advanced Uber or by sitting at the table like a normal Uber. The former is preferable because there are fewer buttons that can make the trick fail crowding up the screen. If that somehow doesn’t bother you, go ahead and take a whole server down.
