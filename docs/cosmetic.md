## Crawl / Oreo Imitation

Friend
{: .label .label-green }
Piggyback
{: .label .label-green }
Hide 'n' Seek Emote
{: .label .label-green }

Have a friend ride you like a certain doggo! It’s quite simple, just piggy with a friend and activate the Hide ‘n’ Seek minigame. If your friend stays on your back, you start to crawl! The person actually crawling won’t notice a difference beyond their movement being a little restricted, but everyone else certainly will!

Ever wanted make a player invisible? This is a great chance for some fun screenshots. During this trick, your friend will be invisible to you but you won't be to them.

1. Have your friend jump on your back.
1. Block them from the friendship menu.
1. Go home, unblock them and teleport back to them.
1. Your friend is now invisible to you!

{: .highlight }
> This works even after going through a [loading zone](../terms-and-methods/#reset-walls-and-loading-zones), so you'll need to restart the game when you want to see your friend again.

## Drone / Rubberbanding

Friend
{: .label .label-green }
Sustained Emote

{: .new }
> Changes have been made to this entry for the  0.19.1 patch!

When being pulled by a friend, spamming any [sustained emote](../terms-and-methods/#sustained-emotes) when they take off from the ground will leave you behind. However, your camera won't quite get the memo and just float out to the midpoint between you and your friend. There are a couple of things that control your camera in this state:

<dl>
    <dt>Flight mode</dt>
    <dd>Camera angles and position will follow the direction your friend is flying.</dd>
    <dt>Glide mode</dt>
    <dd>Camera position, but not angles will follow the direction your friend is flying.</dd>
</dl>

When you're finished, just do any non-sustained emote to return to your friend.

You and your friend may get [server split](../terms-and-methods/#servers) due to large distances between the players.

## Black Mask

Elder Mask

> This entry has been added for the 0.19.1 patch!

This will let you turn your mask completely black! It's a nice visual glitch others can see. The idea is simple: use the broken state of an elder mask on a mask that isn't an elder mask.

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/n5piz6?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Equip a broken elder mask. (If you need to break one, just get hit by a krill or some crabs until it breaks.)
1. Use a spell that replaces your mask.
1. Watch your mask turn black!

{: .note }
> Sometimes other players will see a broken version while you see an unbroken version if you're wearing a mask that's broken only partially. To get it consistent on both screens make sure you're wearing an fully broken one!

## Hold Smuggling

Various Props
{: .label .label-green }
Various Emotes
{: .label .label-green }

{: .new }
> Changes have been made to this entry for the 0.19.1 patch!

This glitch lets you hold props in your hand during animations that normally don't allow you to. Some of these are silly, and a few are actually useful. First, let's cover the main procedure:

1. Hold a prop in your hands.
1. Press the prop icon and the emote icon (must be in "recently used" section) at the same time.

{: .note }
> Sky's menu buttons activate when you *release* them, pressing two buttons at the same time really means they should be *released* together. This is very useful when trying to use lvl. 2+ emotes! Also, changing your [graphics](../terms-and-methods/#graphics-and-fps) to 20 fps may make this trick a bit easier.

Simple, right? The first useful usage of this glitch is holding an umbrella at the same time as your candle. Not that rain is very dangerous to most players, but a solo [capeless](#capeless) user might find it handy!

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/y03ors?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

Now let's get on to the funny animations with emotes. Many emotes just put the prop at the center of your player, but several animations when used with a held prop make the prop do interesting things. In addition, this glitch will let you walk around while doing the emote with the top half of your player until the emote finishes. I recommend the various umbrellas or the lantern in spotlight mode in terms of holdable props.

## Using the Force / Holding Props

Prop
{: .label .label-green }
Lantern Spell
{: .label .label-green }

> Credit: Jesse

This trick lets you hover a prop out in front of you! Others can see it and you can move it around using various stances (though emotes seem to just stick it into your neck. Ouch!). It will stay there until you switch props or go to a new level. This trick can also be done with any umbrella spell.

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/q918ln?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Activate a lantern spell.
2. Cancel the lantern spell.
3. Just after, take out the lantern.

{: .note }
> The goal for this trick is to be taking out a holdable prop as your prop changes to one you normally can't hold.

## Capeless

Warp

Friend's Table
{: .label .label-green }

> Credit: ForestOfLight, Saint, Sensei

All capeless methods have a simple task: Escape the Home void room. When you die outside of Eden, you’re sent Home but far off in the distance in a black room with a star (lovingly named the *pity star*) to start you on your journey. Making it back to the main Home island will let you go into the seven realm gates with no cape! Once you’re capeless, this method needs to be done every time you return home until you decide you want a cape again.

Currently, most capeless methods require three players. One to be capeless, and two friends to get out of the room. Here’s one that only requires two:

1. Die outside of Eden and be sent to the Home void.
2. Have your friend join you at Home (they’ll be on the main island).
3. [Freeze](../terms-and-methods/#freezing) for a couple of seconds and then deep call so your friend can warp to you (your friend should be with you in the Home void at this point. If not, freeze again briefly).
4. Have your friend place down their table.
5. Sit at it and offer your hand to them (let them know when you do because they can’t see you moving).
6. Have your friend close their game, log back in, and warp to your Home (this puts them on the main island).
7. Have your friend place their table on the main island and you’ll go with it!

{: .highlight }
> While you’re at home (after performing the glitch), no one will be able to see you moving around. You can [freeze](../terms-and-methods/#freezing) at any time to update your location on others’ screens.
