## Crawl / Oreo Imitation

Friend
{: .label .label-green }
Piggyback
{: .label .label-green }
Hide 'n' Seek Emote
{: .label .label-green }

Have a friend ride you like a certain doggo! It’s quite simple, just piggy with a friend and activate the Hide ‘n’ Seek minigame. If your friend stays on your back, you start to crawl! The person actually crawling won’t notice a difference beyond their movement being a little restricted, but everyone else certainly will!

Ever wanted make a player invisible? This is a great chance for some fun screenshots. During this trick, your friend will be invisible to you but you won't be to them.

1. Have your friend jump on your back.
2. Block them from the friendship menu.
3. Go home, unblock them and teleport back to them.
4. Your friend is now invisible to you!

{: .highlight }
> This works even after going through a [loading zone](../terms-and-methods/#reset-walls-and-loading-zones), so you'll need to restart the game when you want to see your friend again.

## Drone

Friend
{: .label .label-green }
Sustained Emote
{: .label .label-green }

When being pulled by a friend, spamming any [sustained emote](../terms-and-methods/#sustained-emotes) when they take off from the ground will leave you behind. However, your camera won't quite get the memo and just float out to the midpoint between you and your friend. There are a couple of things that control your camera in this state:

<dl>
    <dt>Flight mode</dt>
    <dd>Camera angles and position will follow the direction your friend is flying.</dd>
    <dt>Glide mode</dt>
    <dd>Camera position, but not angles will follow the direction your friend is flying.</dd>
</dl>

When you're finished, just do any non-sustained emote to return to your friend.

{: .note }
You and your friend may get [server split](../terms-and-methods/#servers) due to large distances between the players.

## Black Mask

Various Mask Spells
{: .label .label-green }
Elder Mask
{: .label .label-green }

This will let you turn your mask completely black! It's a nice visual glitch others can see. The idea is simple: use the broken state of an elder mask on a mask that isn't an elder mask.

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/n5piz6?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Equip a broken elder mask. (If you need to break one, just get hit by a krill or some crabs until it breaks.)
2. Use a spell that replaces your mask.
3. Watch your mask turn black!

{: .note }
> Sometimes other players will see a broken version while you see an unbroken version if you're wearing a mask that's broken only partially. To get it consistent on both screens make sure you're wearing an fully broken one!

## Firework Suspension

Firework Staff
{: .label .label-green }
Friend
{: .label .label-green }

> Credit: Ren

This is an expansion on the [levitation]](../movement/multi-player/#levitation--stall) glitch. Placing a firework with the firework staff will rotate your player and enable the use of any emotes you might like to use without falling out of the sky!

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.500%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/kld7ko?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. (Optional) Use a table spell to place your table [in the air](../movement/single-player/#midair-prop-placement) or on the ground--or ask a friend to place one.
2. Offer any friend emote to your friend. They should not acccept it.
3. (Optional) Remove your placed table by tapping the table icon in the emote menu (or have your friend do so if the table is theirs).
4. Pull out your firework staff and drag the icon around so that your player rotates.
5. Once you've found a nice spot, just place the firework and put your staff away.
6. You're now floating at an angle midair!

## Hold Smuggling

Various Props
{: .label .label-green }
Various Emotes
{: .label .label-green }

This glitch lets you hold props in your hand during animations that normally don't allow you to. Some of these are silly, and a few are actually useful. First, let's cover the main procedure:

1. Hold a prop in your hands.
2. Press the prop icon and the emote icon (must be in "recently used" section) at the same time.

{: .note }
> Sky's menu buttons activate when you *release* them, so pressing two buttons at the same time really means they should be *released* at the same time. This is very useful when trying to use lvl. 2+ emotes! Also, changing your [graphics](../terms-and-methods/#graphics-and-fps) to 20 fps may make this trick a bit easier.

Simple, right? The first useful usage of this glitch is holding an umbrella at the same time as your candle. Not that rain is very dangerous to most players, but a solo [capeless](#capeless) user might find it handy!

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/y03ors?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

Now let's get on to the funny animations with emotes. Many emotes just put the prop at the center of your player, but several animations when used with a held prop make the prop do interesting things. In addition, this glitch will let you walk around while doing the emote with the top half of your player until the emote finishes. I recommend the various umbrellas or the lantern in spotlight mode in terms of holdable props.

## Capeless

Instant Recharge Spell
{: .label .label-green }
Table
{: .label .label-green }

{: .new }
> This trick has been updated for the 0.20.5 patch!

> Credit: ForestOfLight, Saint, Sensei, Joje

All capeless methods have a simple task: Escape the Home void room. When you die outside of Eden, you’re sent Home but far off in the distance in a black room with a star (lovingly named the *pity star*) to start you on your journey. However, making it back to the main Home island without collecting the pity star will let you go through the seven realm gates with no cape! Once you’re capeless, this method needs to be done every time you return Home until you decide you want a cape again.

Here's one method you can do by yourself, one that requires a friend, and several more that require two friends:

For all methods, you must lose all your stars outside of Eden and be sent to the Home void before you start.

Single-player:
<div style="width:50%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:77.867%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/9p19gk?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>
1. Use an instant recharge spell.
2. [Table fling](../advanced/#table-fling-v2) facing to the left of the star in the Home void.
3. You should arrive at the main island.

Two-player:
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ebamfhak_rQ" title="Two-Player Capeless by Moth TV" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
1. Collect the pity star at Home.
2. Have your friend join you at the Home island.
3. Start a [table uber](../clipping/#table-uber) (you place the table, they offer) and then have them [freeze](../terms-and-methods/#freezing).
   1. Your friend can wait to freeze until after the next step if they have an impermenent freeze. They should stay frozen until you arrive back at the main island.

4. Use an instant recharge spell to gain access to your table agian.
5. Drown in the water around the Home island.
6. Place your table in the Home void to bring your friend to you.
7. Tap on your friend and then tap the button over their head to follow them.
8. Remove your table by tapping it once in the emote menu.
9. Tap on your friend's "hold hands" icon to be teleported to them at the main island.

Three-player:
1. Have your friends join you at Home (they’ll be on the main island).
2. Your two friends should use any method to reach the Home void. Here are a few:
   1.  [Sonic](../advanced/#sonic--supersonic-drive). They can use the gondola prop to drive on water and use piggyback to slow down the ride so they don't overshoot.
   2.  [Directional rocket](../movement/multi-player/#directional-rocket). One friend should aim and the other friend should hold a chat prop for step 3.
   3.  Deanport. Use a normal table for setup and the hexagon or hammock props to boost the distance.
3. You should then use any method to reach the main island. Here are a few:
   1. [Poof warp](../movement/multi-player/#poof-warp-v2). Make sure your friends bring a hammock to the void with them!
   2. [Table uber](../clipping/#table-uber). After you are anchored to the table, the table owner can relog to return to the main island and place their table down to bring you to them.

> While you’re in the home world (even after making it back to the main island) no one will be able to see you moving around or speaking.
