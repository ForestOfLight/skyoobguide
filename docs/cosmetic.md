## Crawl / Oreo Imitation

Friend
{: .label .label-green }
Piggyback
{: .label .label-green }
Hide 'n' Seek Emote
{: .label .label-green }

Have a friend ride you like a certain doggo! It’s quite simple, just piggy with a friend and activate the Hide ‘n’ Seek minigame. If your friend stays on your back, you start to crawl! The person actually crawling won’t notice a difference beyond their movement being a little restricted, but everyone else certainly will!

## Candle Hold Smuggling

Prop
{: .label .label-green }

If you have a prop active, you can tap your prop and candle at the same time to take out both at once. Because you need the emote menu open, this doesn’t work with props that bring up their own UI, like instruments. This trick is best used with an Umbrella. No more getting wet while burning those darkness plants!

## Prop Popper / Prop Hold Smuggling

Prop
{: .label .label-green }
Confetti Emote
{: .label .label-green }

Shoot your props into the air! Similar to Candle Hold Smuggling, you just tap your prop and the confetti emote at the same time to send your prop flying! Because you need the emote menu open, this doesn’t work with props that bring up their own UI, like instruments. However, if you’re holding the hand of a friend and have any prop active, they can do the confetti emote for you.

## Lighthouse / Spotlight Hold Smuggling

Lantern
{: .label .label-green }
Spin Trick Emote
{: .label .label-green }

This little trick is a fun combination of the other hold smuggling tricks that turns you into a rapidly spinning lighthouse! Careful not to blind anyone in the vicinity! It’s a little hard not to.

1. Take out the Lantern and switch it to “Spotlight mode.”
2. Initiate the Spin Trick emote and Lantern again at the same time.

## Holding Props / Using the Force

Prop
{: .label .label-green }
Lantern Spell

This trick lets you hold a prop out in front of you! Others can see it and you can move it around using various stances (emotes seem to just stick it into your neck. Ouch!). It will stay there until you switch props or go to a new level. This trick can also be done with any umbrella spell.

1. Activate a lantern spell.
2. Cancel the lantern spell.
3. Just after, tap your prop.

## Capeless

Friend

All capeless methods have a simple task: Escape the Home void room. When you die outside of Eden, you’re sent Home but far off in the distance in a black room with a star to start you on your journey. Making it back to the main Home island will let you go into the seven realm gates with no cape!

Currently, most capeless methods require three players. One to be capeless, and two friends to get out of the room. Here’s one that only requires two:

1. Die outside of Eden and be sent to the Home void.
2. Have your friend join you at Home (they’ll be on the main island).
3. [Freeze](./terms-and-methods/#freezing) for a couple of seconds and then deep call so your friend can warp to you (your friend should be with you in the Home void at this point. If not, freeze again briefly).
4. Have your friend place down their table.
5. Sit at it and offer your hand to them (let them know when you do because they can’t see you moving).
6. Have your friend close their game, log back in, and warp to your Home (this puts them on the main island).
7. Have your friend place their table on the main island and you’ll go with it!

Once you’re capeless, this method needs to be done every time you return home until you collect a star and have a cape again. While you’re at home (after performing the glitch), no one will be able to see you moving around. You can [freeze](./terms-and-methods/#freezing) at any time to update your location on others’ screens.
