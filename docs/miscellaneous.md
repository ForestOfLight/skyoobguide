## Efficient Candle Collection

Collecting candles quickly isn't too important, but it's a good way to stop having to ignore that blinking red dot without slowing down your candle run! Collecting candles just before going through a [loading zone](./terms-and-methods/#reset-walls-and-loading-zones) will skip the animation of collecting them. You can also easily collect candles before going Home because the "sit to go home" animation interrupts the candle collection animation.

## Spell Saver

Placeable Prop
{: .label .label-green }

It’s possible to place a prop spell without using up the prop. After activating the spell and dragging it out of the spell menu, tap anywhere outside the menu without lifting your finger to place the spell. The spell will be added back to your inventory!

## Rainbow Bridge

Rainbow Spell
{: .label .label-green }

Wait, but isn’t that an OOB location? Yep, but it’s also its own glitch, completely unrelated to the OOB location in Isle of Dawn. This trick lets you place a rainbow spell horizontally so that you can walk on it!

1. Initiate the rainbow spell.
2. Position your camera straight down.
3. Tap the rainbow icon quickly to place it down (use graphics setting 0 if you’re having trouble).

## Reset Wall Removal / Immortality

This glitch has a very important function: It lets you go right through anything that might reset you. That includes both [reset walls](./terms-and-methods/#reset-walls-and-loading-zones) and pesky fire trial demons (because they count as reset zones). The basic idea is to cut off transmission to Sky’s servers, enter an area, pass a reset wall, and then reconnect to the servers. Disconnecting from the servers is a little different for each platform. iOS is a little more inconsistent than Android due to this process.

- For Android: Simply disable wifi and data. Press retry when the reconnection box pops up.
- For iOS: Do the same as Android, but when you encounter the “Connect to the Internet to Continue Playing” screen, enable data from the Control Center (the menu when you swipe up from the bottom of the screen) and, without closing the Control Center, disable it once the screen disappears. It will come up again after a few seconds, so be prepared to do this process a lot. It might help to be on graphics setting 0 if you’re having trouble.

1. Disconnect from wifi and data outside of the area where you’d like to remove reset points.
2. Travel into the area.
3. Hit a reset point (often you’ll need to go OOB somehow).
4. Turn wifi and data back on.
