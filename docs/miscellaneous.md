## Efficient Candle Collection

Collecting candles quickly isn't too important, but it's a good way to stop having to ignore that blinking red dot without slowing down your candle run! Collecting candles just before going through a [loading zone](./terms-and-methods/#reset-walls-and-loading-zones) will skip the animation of collecting them. You can also easily collect candles before doing many other actions because their animations interrupts the candle collection animation. One convinient time may be before going home.

## Rainbow Bridge

Rainbow Spell
{: .label .label-green }

Wait, but isn’t that an OOB location? Yep, but it’s also its own glitch, completely unrelated to the OOB location in Isle of Dawn. This trick lets you place a rainbow spell horizontally so that you can walk on it!

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/38ca6d?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Initiate the rainbow spell.
2. Position your camera straight down.
3. Tap the rainbow icon quickly to place it down (use [graphics setting](../../terms-and-methods/#graphics-and-fps) 0 if you’re having trouble).
