## Efficient Candle Collection
What you need: N/A
Collecting a candle just before whiting or blacking out (when the screen turns all white or black, like when traveling to a new area) will skip the animation of collecting the candle. You can also easily collect a candle while going Home by simply tapping the candle before you sit to go Home. Video

Spell Saver
What you need: Any placeable prop spell
It’s possible to place a prop spell without using up the prop. After activating the spell and dragging it out of the spell menu, tap anywhere outside the menu without lifting your finger to place the spell. The spell will be added back to your inventory! Video

Rainbow Bridge
What you need: A rainbow spell
Wait, but isn’t that an OOB spot? Yep, but it’s also its own glitch, completely unrelated to the OOB spot. This trick lets you place a rainbow spell horizontally so that you can walk on it! Spell Saver won’t work for this glitch, so it does consume a real spell. Video
Initiate the rainbow spell.
Position your camera straight down.
Tap the rainbow icon quickly to place it down (use graphics setting 0 if you’re having trouble).

Reset Wall Removal / Immortality
What you need: N/A
This glitch has a very important function: It lets you go right through anything that might reset you. That includes both reset walls and pesky fire trial demons. The basic idea is to cut off transmission to Sky’s servers, enter an area, pass a reset wall, and then reconnect to the servers. Disconnecting from the servers is a little different for each platform. iOS is a little more inconsistent than Android due to this process. Videos: Android, iOS
For Android: Simply disable wifi and data. Press retry when the reconnection box pops up.
For iOS: Do the same as Android, but when you encounter the “Connect to the Internet to Continue Playing” screen, enable data from the Control Center (the menu when you swipe up from the bottom of the screen) and, without closing the Control Center, disable it once the screen disappears. It will come up again after a few seconds, so be prepared to do this process a lot. It might help to be on graphics setting 0 if you’re having trouble.
To perform:
Disconnect from wifi and data outside of the area where you’d like to remove reset points.
Travel into the area.
Hit a reset point (often you’ll need to go OOB somehow).
Turn wifi and data back on.
