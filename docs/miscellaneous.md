## Flight Regen

{: .label label-green }
Friend
{: .label .label-green }
Piggyback

This trick is extremely popular in the Sky community right now, and it's not hard to see why. It recharges your light so quickly you don't even need to worry about your wedges. It's also extremely simple:

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/v7viz5?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Have your friend get on your back.
2. Have them open your friendship menu and tap on something you haven't purchased yet (can be the "send heart" icon).
3. Don't complete the transaction in order to keep the candle out.

## Portrait Mode

Sky actually has a built-in portrait mode that isn't accessible on most devices but has been in beta development for quite some time. If you have an iPad or tablet on Live, you can just turn your device vertically to play in portrait mode but most phones aren't so lucky. Instead, we can force Sky into portait mode on iOS 15 and below by making another app turn your device vertical: the Photos app!

1. Start recording using the video feature ingame.
2. Stop recording.
3. When the "share video" menu pops up, tap "Add to Shared Album."
4. Turn your device vertically.
5. Click "cancel" and then close the menu.
6. Sky is now in portrait mode!

{: .important }
> There may be other ways to force sky into this mode on other devices, but they haven't been brought to my attention. Please let me know if you know of other ways to complete this workaround!

## Efficient Candle Collection

Collecting candles quickly isn't too important, but it's a good way to stop having to ignore that blinking red dot without slowing down your candle run! Collecting candles just before going through a [loading zone](../terms-and-methods/#reset-walls-and-loading-zones) will skip the animation of collecting them. You can also easily collect candles before doing many other actions because their animations interrupts the candle collection animation. One convinient time may be before going home.

## Rainbow Bridge

Rainbow Spell
{: .label .label-green }

Wait, but isn’t that an OOB location? Yep, but it’s also its own glitch, completely unrelated to the OOB location in Isle of Dawn. This trick lets you place a rainbow spell horizontally so that you can walk on it!

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/38ca6d?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Initiate the rainbow spell.
1. Position your camera straight down.
1. Tap the rainbow icon quickly to place it down (use [graphics setting](../terms-and-methods/#graphics-and-fps) 0 if you’re having trouble).

## Multi-Piggy

Friends
{: .label .label-green }
Piggyback
{: .label .label-green }

Flying around with a lot of other players can be tough, why not just carry everyone on your back so they don't get in the way? By accepting multiple piggyback requests at once, any number of players can fit on your back!

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.500%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/w32k44?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>
