# Clipping
{: .no_toc }

In most games, clipping is described as going through a [collision box](../terms-and-methods/#collision-boxes). The most popular clipping method in Sky is the infamous [Chibi Clip](#chibi-clip-/-chibi-fall) -- one of the first tricks new OOBers learn -- however, there are many more methods of clipping if you care to learn them.

## Chibi Clip / Chibi Fall

Sneaky Stance
{: .label .label-green}

A chibi clip can be performed on just about any slope to let you go underground by pushing your Sky Kid’s foot under the floor and then having the rest of your body follow it. This is done by using the sneaky stance and legging a foot towards an incline.

1. Hold down on your Sky Kid’s feet and pull a leg towards an upwards slope.
1. Hold your foot there and place a finger on the joystick.
1. Release your feet and immediately make a small step forward with the joystick (You already had your finger on it).

## Rocket / Piggy

> Rockets are broken in patch 0.19.0, but they're rumored to return soon!

When two players attempt to give each other a piggyback at the same time, both players will go flying up into the air regardless of any collision boxes in their path (NOTE: Clouds are not collision boxes and can sometimes stand in your way!). Simply let go of the other player to stop the launch.

For most players, this is enough to know. If you'd like to learn more about fine tuning your rockets, head down to the [advanced](#rocket-advanced) section.

Rocketing is a bit of an art. It may seem inconsistent because there are many factors to determine your launch. First, you must understand that what your screen shows and what your friend’s screen shows are different. Each player launches in the direction they’re facing (as well as up). The player to let go of the other first will be the leader. Whoever doesn’t let go will be sent to the other player. So, decide who will lead before launching, and position the leader facing the desired launch direction with the other player in front of them, facing them. 

Here are two videos showing the same launch from both players’ perspectives. Notice the difference in direction.

| Player One                                            | Player Two                                             |

Something else to take into account when rocketing is player height. Jumping onto a smaller player will give you a larger angle. Jumping onto a larger player will give you a smaller angle.

Another factor is your graphics settings. Changing the game’s FPS will change the speed of the launch from your point of view (0 is 2/3 speed, 1&3 are normal, 2 is 2x speed).

If you’d like to go underwater, simply start the rocket in the water. Only one player will go underwater so that player must let go. Be wary of crashes!

As of patch 0.14.5, the only effect of the Bicycle [PATCHED] glitch is that it will send both players on the same Rocket-like trajectory.
