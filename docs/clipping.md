# Clipping
In most gmaes, clipping is described as going through a wall or other solid object. These solid objects are called "*collision boxes*," and they're just about anything your player can bump into -- walls, ceilings, objects, even other players! The most popular clipping method in Sky is the infamous [Chibi Clip](#chibi-clip), one of the first tricks new OOBers learn.

Sneaky Stance
{: .label .label-green}

A chibi clip can be performed on just about any slope to let you go underground by pushing your Sky Kid’s foot under the floor and then having the rest of your body follow it. This is done by using the sneaky stance and legging a foot towards an incline. Video (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uddMGrMCUWCpPIkYWRM7GE0CvnNHy4L5/view?usp=sharing)

1. Hold down on your Sky Kid’s feet and pull a leg towards an upwards slope.
1. Hold your foot there and place a finger on the joystick.
1. Release your feet and immediately make a small step forward with the joystick (You already had your finger on it).
