# Clipping
{: .no_toc }

In most games, clipping is described as going through a [collision box](../terms-and-methods/#collision-boxes). The most popular clipping method in Sky is the infamous [chibi clip](#chibi-clip--chibi-fall) -- one of the first tricks new OOBers learn -- however, there are many more methods of clipping if you care to learn them.

## Chibi Clip / Chibi Fall

Chibi Mask / Shrink Spell
{: .label .label-green}
Sneaky Stance
{: .label .label-green}

A chibi clip can be performed on just about any slope to let you go underground by pushing your Sky Kid’s foot under the floor and then having the rest of your body follow it. This is done by using the sneaky stance and legging a foot towards an incline.

1. Hold down on your sky kid’s feet and pull a leg towards an upwards slope.
2. Hold your foot there and place a finger on the joystick.
3. Release your feet and immediately make a small step forward with the joystick.

## Rocket

Friend
{: .label .label-green }
Piggyback
{: .label .label-green }

{: .warning }
> If any other players in the level are also piggybacked, attempting to rocket will crash Sky!

When two players attempt to give each other a piggyback at the same time, both players will go flying up into the air regardless of any collision boxes or wind walls in their path. Simply let go of the other player to stop the launch.

## Spasm v2

Friend

Piggyback

After much patching by tgc, [spasm](../patched/0.15.0-0.19.1/#spasm--follow-clip) still exists. This clip can push you through horizontal [collision boxes](../terms-and-methods/#collision-boxes) above you (ie. ceilings) or vertical [collision boxes](../terms-and-methods/#collision-boxes) (ie. walls). The clip is best used on a flat ceiling but can work on heavily sloped ones as well. When clipping through a wall, make sure the wall is either vertical ( \| ) or getting steeper ( \ ), not shallower ( / ). Using a ceiling corner is most ideal. 

[Instrument Spasm](#instrument-spasm) is the simplest way to pull off this glitch, but here are two more ways to get the "follow" button to show up while a friend is on your back:

## Instrument Spasm

Various Instruments
{: .label .label-green }

> Credit: Astria Esper

The revival of the beloved [spasm](../patched/0.15.0-0.19.1/#spasm--follow-clip) glitch. This clip lets you go through [collision boxes](../terms-and-methods/#collision-boxes) that are next to or above you. The original spasm glitch worked by following a friend who was on your back. This newer version of spasm uses an instrument for you to be able to follow your friend midair by forcing their player into a location further away from you. In addition, this is a great way to recharge your light while away from the ground!

{: .highlight }
> The best instruments for this glitch are the guitar, rhythm guitar, ukulele, and lute. If you don't have access to any of those, the piano, winter piano, drum, sanctuary handpan, triumph handpan work alright as well.

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/djxv13?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Have your friend jump on your back.
2. Position yourself as close to the [collision box](../terms-and-methods/#collision-boxes) as you can.
3. Fly (or you can stay on the ground, and fly at the end of the trick).
4. Have your friend play their instrument so that their player moves below you.
5. When your friend is below you, tap on your friend to follow them.
6. You'll start slowly moving on top of your friend and clipping through any collision boxes in the way!
7. Move the joystick to stop the spasm.

{: .note }
> If you're having trouble clipping through a collision box, changing your [fps](../terms-and-methods/#graphics-and-fps) to a lower setting might do the trick.

## Piggy Emote Clip

Friend
{: .label .label-green }
Piggyback
{: .label .label-green }
Various Emotes
{: .label .label-green }

When the bottom player of a piggyback stack does a [sustained emote](../terms-and-methods/#sustained-emotes), the position of the center of their player changes, so the other players on their back move with them. Since these emotes can bring that player's [collision box](../terms-and-methods/#collision-boxes) out of bounds, the players on their back will be taken out of bounds as well! These players need only to dismount to go out of bounds. This clip is super useful for getting through all sorts of collision boxes. The best emote to use for this clip is the play dead (faint) emote, though others like point and come are also quite effective. It’s a good idea to have warp unlocked with your friend as well since this doesn't let the bottom player clip.

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/ukn0vt?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Piggyback on a friend.
2. Have them line up to a collision box where an emote would make them clip through it.
   1.  Play dead makes them fall to the right, so line them up with a wall or an uphill slope on their right.
3. Have them use the their emote of choice.
4. You (on their back) will be inside the wall, just hop off!
5. If you can offer your friend your hand, that will bring them to you--otherwise, they can warp.

{: .note }
> The game will attempt to reset your positon when you jump off your friend's back, but that can easily be worked-around by just dragging the joystick to move further out of bounds when getting off.

## Table Uber

Friend
{: .label .label-green }
Table
{: .label .label-green }

{: .new }
> This trick has been updated for the 0.20.5 patch!

This clip is a ton of fun to play around with. Essentially, it lets you move around other players wherever you can place your table. It’s easiest to get the side chairs on normal tables out of bounds rather than the middle ones, so it’s best to have your friends there. It’s also preferable to have warp with your friend(s) since this will not make you clip.

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/wxakp1?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Have your friend place their placeable chat prop.
2. Sit down at it, then tap on a friend, and offer them a hand. 
3. The friend does not take your hand, it should stay offering.
4. They can then move around their table with you (and anyone else) on it!
   1. You will be able to place your friend down with your table, but they will not slide around with your table like in older versions.
5. Simply position the table where one of the players would be outside the desired wall and place it down to clip them out of bounds.
   1. You likely won't be able to get them out of bounds on the first placement, so try placing the table quickly a bunch of times until they end up oob. (When you drag it out its position is valid for a split second, where your friends will automatically move.)
6. Warp to your friend.

## Campfire Clip / Table Ceiling Clip

Campfire / Teaset

Clipping through the roof on your own can be simple for a veteran! Since the campfire and tea table’s seats are so close to the ceiling, you can go right through. Placement can be difficult, however. Make sure your table is as horizontal as possible. If you’re tall and going OOB solo, this is one of the best tools you can use to get out of bounds.


<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:55.625%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/ngvjah?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Place your campfire on the ceiling.
1. Sit in one of the seats.
1. Jump out with a flick of the joystick or fly upward, whichever works.

{: .highlight }
> If you don’t have enough wedges to reach your fire,  you can always pair this glitch with the [Table Drive](../movement/multi-player/#table-drive) glitch for a wedge-free way of sitting at your table.

## Memory Candle Clip

Memory Candle Spell

When you discard a recorded memory, your player gets offset a little from where you started it. This can take us right through walls! Though it used to be able to take you through any wall, it's now only useful for very tight spaces you'd like to get out of.

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.500%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/xcd2pe?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Use a memory candle spell.
2. Start recording.
3. Stop recording.
4. Discard your memory.

## General Table Clip

Table
{: .label .label-green }

This clip has been used for an extremely long time but has since been almost completely patched out. However, it’s still possible in some places with a bit of practice and determination.

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/n9z533?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Place your table where one (or more) chair(s) are outside the wall you’d like to clip into.
2. If you can, sit in the chair(s) outside the wall and you’ll be out of bounds.
3. This can also be positioned such that upon getting out of the chair, you’ll be pushed out of bounds. This is the more likely method to work.

## General Clipping

It’s also important to know that two collision boxes that are close enough together can push you through one of them. For example, I once accidentally clipped into the all-elder room (OOB in the room after meditating at the Vault elder shrine) just by walking under a chair from a table at the right angle as a chibi. I wouldn’t recommend trying this as a legitimate clip method unless you know two collision boxes will work to push you through consistently. Here's an extremely well known general clip:
