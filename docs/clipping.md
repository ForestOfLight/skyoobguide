# Clipping
{: .no_toc }

In most games, clipping is described as going through a [collision box](../terms-and-methods/#collision-boxes). The most popular clipping method in Sky is the infamous [chibi clip](#chibi-clip--chibi-fall) -- one of the first tricks new OOBers learn -- however, there are many more methods of clipping if you care to learn them.

## Chibi Clip / Chibi Fall

Chibi Mask / Shrink Potion
{: .label .label-green}
Sneaky Stance
{: .label .label-green}

A chibi clip can be performed on just about any slope to let you go underground by pushing your Sky Kid’s foot under the floor and then having the rest of your body follow it. This is done by using the sneaky stance and legging a foot towards an incline.

1. Hold down on your sky kid’s feet and pull a leg towards an upwards slope.
1. Hold your foot there and place a finger on the joystick.
2. Release your feet and immediately make a small step forward with the joystick.

## Rocket / Piggy

Friend
{: .label .label-green }
Piggyback
{: .label .label-green }

When two players attempt to give each other a piggyback at the same time, both players will go flying up into the air regardless of any collision boxes in their path. Simply let go of the other player to stop the launch.

{: .note }
> Clouds and other winds are not [collision boxes](../terms-and-methods/#collision-boxes) and can sometimes stand in your way!

## Spiral v2

Friend
{: .label .label-green }
Piggyback
{: .label .label-green }

Spiraling is similar to [rocketing](#rocket--piggy), but it’s slower and more maneuverable. It’s performed in the same way as a Rocket, but one player offers to hold hands while the other asks for a piggyback. Both players will go through collision boxes. Simply let go of the other player to stop the launch.

## Floor Clip

Friend
{: .label .label-green }
Piggyback
{: .label .label-green }
Play Dead / Crab Walk (lvl 3) Emote
{: .label .label-green }

This clip can push you through horizontal [collision boxes](../terms-and-methods/#collision-boxes) below you (like the ground!). It is best used on flat ground but can work on slopes. It’s preferable that you have warp unlocked with your friend as well since this only lets one player clip.

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/au276o?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Jump on a friend’s back with piggyback.
2. Have your friend use the play dead or crab walk (lvl 3) emote.
3. Get off your friend’s back, and you should fall through the floor. Your friend can then warp to you.

## Play Dead Clip / Piggy Wall Clip

Friend
{: .label .label-green }
Piggyback
{: .label .label-green }
Play Dead Emote
{: .label .label-green }

This clip is useful for getting through vertical [collision boxes](../terms-and-methods/#collision-boxes). It’s preferable to have warp unlocked with your friend as well since this only lets one player clip.

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/ukn0vt?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Piggyback on a friend.
2. Have them line up facing perpendicular to the wall where the play dead emote would make them fall towards the wall (right). 
3. Make sure they are as close to the wall as possible. Have them use the play dead emote.
4. You (on their back) will be inside the wall, just hop off! Your friend can then warp to you.

## Table Uber / Multi-Player Table Clip
Friend
{: .label .label-green }
Table
{: .label .label-green }

This clip is a ton of fun to play around with. Essentially, it lets you move around other players wherever you can move your table. It’s easiest to get the side chairs out of bounds rather than the middle ones, so it’s best to have your friends there. It’s preferable to have warp with your friend since this will not make you clip (or use an [Advanced Uber](../advanced/#drive--advanced-table-uber)).

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/ne7v5a?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Have your friend place their table or campfire. 
2. Sit down at it, then tap on a friend, and offer them a hand. 
3. The friend does not take your hand, it should stay offering. They can then move around their table with you (and anyone else) on it! 
4. Simply position the table where one of the players would be outside the desired wall and place it down to clip.
5. Warp to your friend.

## Campfire Clip / Table Ceiling Clip

Campfire / Teaset
{: .label .label-green }

> Credit: Hiddles

Clipping through the roof on your own can be simple for a veteran! Since the campfire and tea table’s seats are so close to the ceiling, you can go right through. Placement can be difficult, however. Make sure your table is as horizontal as possible. If you’re tall and going OOB solo, this is one of the best tools you can use to get out of bounds.


<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:55.625%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/ngvjah?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Place your campfire on the ceiling.
2. Sit in one of the seats.
3. Jump out with a flick of the joystick or fly upward, whichever works.

{: .highlight }
> If you don’t have enough wedges to reach your fire,  you can always pair this glitch with the Checkpoint glitch for a wedge-free way of sitting at your table.

## General Table Clip

Table
{: .label .label-green }

This clip has been used for an extremely long time but has since been almost completely patched out. However, it’s still possible in some places with a bit of practice and determination.

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/n9z533?loop=0" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Place your table where one (or more) chair(s) are outside the wall you’d like to clip into.
2. If you can, sit in the chair(s) outside the wall and you’ll be out of bounds.
3. This can also be positioned such that upon getting out of the chair, you’ll be pushed out of bounds. This is the more likely method to work.

## General Clipping

It’s also important to know that two collision boxes that are close enough together can push you through one of them. For example, I once accidentally clipped into the All-Elder room (OOB in the room just before Eden’s social area and right after meditating at the Vault elder shrine) just by walking under a chair from a table at the right angle as a chibi. I wouldn’t recommend trying this as a legitimate clip method unless you know two collision boxes will work to push you through consistently (i.e. the clip in the skip for the second half of the Eye of Eden).
